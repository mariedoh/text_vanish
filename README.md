7 Second Danger

Overview
7 Second Danger is a web-based writing application inspired by the [Dangerous Writing Prompt App](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). 
The core concept is simple yet challenging: if the user stops writing for 7 consecutive seconds, all progress is lost.
This encourages users to focus intensely on writing without distractions.

Features
- Welcome Page: A brief introduction to the rules and purpose of the app, with an option to start or exit.
- Text Editor with Timer: The main writing page includes:
  - A timer that resets as the user types.
  - A mechanism to erase all text if the timer reaches zero.
  - A high score tracker

How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `text.html`, `style.css`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to begin.

Future Enhancements
- UI Improvements: Add animations, dynamic backgrounds, or a dark mode toggle.
- Gamification: Include difficulty levels, achievements, and a leaderboard.
- Sound Effects: Play feedback sounds for typing, timeouts, and button clicks.
